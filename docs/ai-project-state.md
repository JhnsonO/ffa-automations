## Flatcam — lens strength + venue mask RESOLVED (9 July 2026, later still, `5d335a2`/`6d7d3f9`)

**Correction strength confirmed by Johnson: raw (0.0), deferred not final.** `flatcam/lens_profiles.json` MSV profile fixed: `distortion_correction_strength: 0.0`, `calibration_status: "deferred"`. Note: live `main` had drifted to `f90d967`'s `strength=1.0/fov=170`, self-described in its own commit/notes as "visually_tuned" — this was a live contradiction against this state file's own record of Johnson rejecting that render as over-corrected. Resolved in favour of this file's human-verified record; `f90d967`'s self-assessment was wrong. Flag for future sessions: don't trust a commit's own notes over Johnson's actual recorded verdict when they conflict.

**Venue mask written:** `flatcam/venues/st_margarets_msv.json`, the 24-point polygon Johnson approved (raw frame-pixel space, 3840x2160). Since strength=0.0 is a verified true identity map in `undistort.py` (`map_x=xs, map_y=ys` exactly when `s=0`), raw space = undistorted space here, so the approved points were written directly, no transform needed.

**Not yet done:** `render_segment_flat.py` re-run with both fixes — needs real MSV footage (`GX010424 copy.mp4` / `GX010424.MP4`), which is not present in this session's sandbox and was never committed to the repo (local-only per last session's note). Re-source from Drive (`footffa@gmail.com`, id `1xfr5gvMeYtkyVs1DdqU3GROcuVUt6BvQ`) or get a fresh clip from Johnson before this can run — CPU-only local pipeline, no workflow/dispatch needed once footage is available.

**Next gate:** get real footage, run `render_segment_flat.py --profile gopro_max2_msv_4k60 --venue flatcam/venues/st_margarets_msv.json`, visual sign-off from Johnson before calling flatcam done.

## Flatcam — pan-only v1 (9 July 2026, merge `e3b0f296`)

**FOLLOW-mode zoom removed per Johnson's request.** `flatcam/follow_camera_flat.py` FOLLOW mode now uses `self._wide_size()` for crop dimensions (same as WIDE_FALLBACK) instead of a fixed 0.55x zoom — crop size is constant across all modes, only `cx`/`cy` pan. Verified: 3s real-footage re-render (`GX010424`, frames ~128-131s) shows crop_w/crop_h constant at 3840x2160 across all 180 frames, both FOLLOW and WIDE_FALLBACK modes. Zoom deferred to v2, not deleted.

**First real-footage render also verified today** (pre-pan-only): 3s segment, output valid, FOLLOW mode engaged correctly on real footage for the first time.

**Next gate:** Johnson visual sign-off on pan-only render. If approved, flatcam v1 (pan-only, raw lens correction) is done — zoom tuning is a separate future task, not started.
